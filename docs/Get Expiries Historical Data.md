# Expired Historical Candle Data | Upstox Developer API

## Developer API - Expired Instruments - Get Expired Historical Candle Data

### Get Expired Historical Candle Data

This API extends the functionality of the existing **Get Historical Candle Data API** by allowing users to query data for expired contracts.

This API is particularly useful for traders and analysts who need to analyze past performance and trends of expired contracts.

It provides historical **Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC)** data for expired contracts, available across multiple time intervals including:
`1minute`, `3minute`, `5minute`, `15minute`, `30minute`, and `day`.

> **NOTE:**
>
> * Before using this API, utilize the **Get Expired Option Contracts API** or **Get Expired Future Contracts API** to obtain the `expired_instrument_key` for the expired contracts.
> * This key, required as a path parameter, is a combination of the standard instrument key and expiry date returned by the previously mentioned APIs.
> * For OHLC data of an **active contract**, use the **Historical Candle Data API**.

> **IMPORTANT:**
>
> * Expired Historical Candle Data is currently not available for the **MCX**.
> * This API is specifically for expired contracts that have passed their expiry date.

Would you like me to **merge all four docs** (Expiries, Expired Futures, Expired Options, Expired Historical Candle) into a **single Markdown reference guide** so you can use it as a complete handbook?
